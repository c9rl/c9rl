## Carl Bernardo—@c9rl 

👋 Hey, I'm Carl—I'm a software engineer.

🛠️ I'm currently at [TRM Labs](https://www.trmlabs.com/), a blockchain intelligence company building a platform for a safer financial system.

📈 Prior, I spent a few years as tech lead at a fintech company whose mission was to build a financial system that works for everyone. There I built their internal tools ecosystem and launched the product in India and Mexico. 🏗️ Before that, I helped lay the groundwork for a few startups working mainly with JavaScript/React.js, Node.js, and Python. 🦖 In a different time, I worked at a boutique management consulting firm and functioned as their in-house developer.

I hold a MS in Computer Science from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) and a BS in Economics, Japanese, and East Asian Studies from [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I also received the [Monbukagakusho Scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monbukagakusho_Scholarship) in 2011 during my time at [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/). I love a good cup of coffee (seriously, I have a legit setup), but have been shifting to tea as one of my new year's resolutions (it's not going too well). I'm currently in the process of renovating a 100 year-old home with my wife in the neighborhood I grew up in just outside Chicago, IL.
