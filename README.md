## Carl Bernardo—@c9rl 

👋 Hey, I'm Carl—a software engineer and currently, tech lead at [Tala.co](https://tala.co/), where I'm building their internal tools ecosystem. 🏗️ Before that, I helped lay the groundwork for a few startups working mainly with JavaScript/React.js, Node.js, and Python. 🦖 In a different time, I worked at a boutique management consulting firm and functioned as their in-house developer. 

I'm currently having fun playing around with [Deno](https://deno.land/) and wrapping up my MS in Computer Science at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I love a good cup of coffee (no seriously, I have a legit setup) and building mechanical keyboards (I typed this on my RAMA KOYU). Also traveling to new places is 👌.
