## Carl Bernardo—@c9rl 

👋 Hey, I'm Carl—I'm a software engineer.

📈 I spent the last few years as tech lead at a fintech company whose mission was to build a financial system that works for everyone. There I built their internal tools ecosystem and launched the product in India and Mexico. 🏗️ Before that, I helped lay the groundwork for a few startups working mainly with JavaScript/React.js, Node.js, and Python. 🦖 In a different time, I worked at a boutique management consulting firm and functioned as their in-house developer.

I'm currently having fun playing around with [Deno](https://deno.land/) and wrapped up my MS in Computer Science at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I love a good cup of coffee (no seriously, I have a legit setup), but have been shifting to tea as one of my new year's resolutions. I also enjoy building mechanical keyboards (I typed this on my RAMA KOYU) and traveling to new places.
